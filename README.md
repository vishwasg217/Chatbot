# Chatbot for Customer Service

## 1.Overview:
The purpose of this design doc is to outline the development of a chatbot that can interact with customers in a natural language and provide quick and accurate responses to their queries, reducing the response time and increasing customer satisfaction. The solution will involve implementing a conversational AI system, and the desired outcome is to improve customer engagement and reduce the workload on human customer support agents.

## 2. Motivation:
Customer service is a critical aspect of any business, and providing timely and accurate responses to customer queries is essential for maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction. However, customer support agents are often overwhelmed by the volume of queries they receive, leading to long wait times and reduced customer satisfaction. By developing a chatbot that can interact with customers in a natural language and provide quick and accurate responses, businesses can improve customer engagement and reduce the workload on human support agents.

## 3. Success Metrics:
The success of the chatbot will be measured based on the following metrics:

- Customer engagement (e.g., click-through rate, time spent on the platform)
- Reduced response time
- Increased customer satisfaction (e.g., NPS score)

## 4. Requirements & Constraints:
### Functional requirements:
- The chatbot should be able to understand and respond to customer queries in a natural language.
- The chatbot should be integrated with existing customer support platforms.
- The chatbot should provide quick and accurate responses to customer queries.

### Non-functional/technical requirements:
- The chatbot should have low latency and high throughput to ensure quick response times.
- The chatbot should be scalable and able to handle high volumes of queries.
- The chatbot should be secure and protect customer data privacy.

### Constraints:
- The cost of the chatbot should be minimal.
- The chatbot's latency should be below 3 seconds.

## 5. What's in-scope & out-of-scope?
### In-scope:
- Developing a chatbot that can interact with customers in a natural language and provide quick and accurate responses to their queries.
- Integrating the chatbot with existing customer support platforms.

### Out-of-scope:
- Developing a custom customer support platform.

## 6. Methodology:

### Problem Statement:
The problem will be framed as a natural language processing (NLP) problem, where the goal is to develop a system that can understand and respond to customer queries in a natural language.

### Data:
The chatbot will be trained on a dataset of customer queries and responses. The input data needed during serving will be the customer's query.

The model will be trained on the [Twitter Customer Support Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter) 

### Techniques:
The chatbot will use NLP techniques such as intent recognition, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis to understand customer queries and generate appropriate responses. The data will be cleaned and prepared by removing outliers and irrelevant data, and features will be created using techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF and word embeddings.

### Experimentation & Validation:
The chatbot will be validated offline by testing its accuracy and response time on a held-out test set. Evaluation metrics will include precision, recall, and F1 score. A/B testing will be used to measure the success of the chatbot in production. 

## 7. Project Schedule
### Week 1

**Day 1-5: Learn Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning Fundamentals**
NLP is an essential part of chatbot development. You can start with a beginner-level NLP course, such as the one provided by Stanford.

**Day 6-7: Explore Chatbot Platforms**
There are various chatbot development platforms available that can help you get started quickly. Explore platforms like Dialogflow, Botpress, and BotStar.

### Week 2

**Day 8-9: Data Collection and Preprocessing**
Collect and preprocess customer interaction data to train your chatbot. You can use publicly available datasets or collect data from social media platforms or customer service logs.

**Day 10-11: Develop the Chatbot Model**
Use deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch or Tensorflow to develop the chatbot model. Start with a simple model and gradually add complexity to it.

**Day 12-13: Train and Test the Chatbot Model**
Train the chatbot model using the preprocessed data and test it with a small set of customer queries to ensure its accuracy.

**Day 14: Integrate the Chatbot into Deriskly Platform**
Integrate the chatbot model into the Deriskly platform to enable customers to interact with it easily.
